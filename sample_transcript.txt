Sarah: Thanks everyone for joining. Let's dive into our Q4 priorities. First item - the API refactoring project. John, can you take the lead on this?

John: Absolutely. I've reviewed the current architecture and I think we can complete the refactoring in about 3 weeks. I'll start next Monday and aim to have it done by end of December.

Sarah: Perfect. What about resources? Do you need anyone else on this?

John: I'll work with Mike on the backend pieces. Mike, can you allocate about 10 hours per week for the next three weeks?

Mike: Yes, that works for me. I'll block out Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

Sarah: Great. Lisa, let's talk about the dashboard redesign. Where are we on that?

Lisa: I've completed the initial wireframes. I'm planning to have high-fidelity mockups ready by December 20th. I'll need feedback from the team by then so we can finalize before the holidays.

Sarah: Sounds good. I'll make sure we schedule a design review for December 21st. Everyone please keep that date open.

John: Will do. Quick question - are we still planning to use the same component library?

Lisa: Yes, we're sticking with Material-UI but upgrading to the latest version for better performance.

Sarah: Next topic - the mobile app. We need to make a decision on the tech stack today. John, you had some thoughts on this?

John: Right. I've been researching options and I strongly recommend React Native. It gives us cross-platform support, we can reuse a lot of our existing React code, and the team already knows JavaScript.

Mike: I agree. The alternative would be native development, but that means maintaining two separate codebases.

Sarah: Makes sense. Let's go with React Native then. That's decided. Lisa, can you start creating mobile mockups? We'll need those by December 15th to stay on schedule.

Lisa: Absolutely. I'll prioritize the main user flows first - login, dashboard, and transaction screens.

Sarah: Perfect. One more thing - we've been getting requests for dark mode support. Is that something we can fit into Q4?

Lisa: I can include dark mode in the mobile designs from the start. For the web app, it would be additional work.

John: If Lisa designs it, I can implement dark mode for web in January. It's not too complex with our current setup.

Sarah: Okay, let's plan for mobile dark mode in Q4 and web dark mode in Q1. 

Mike: I have a concern about backend resources. With the API refactoring and the new mobile app, we might need additional backend support. Should we start looking for a contractor?

Sarah: Good point. Let me discuss with leadership and get back to you by end of this week. In the meantime, let's document exactly what backend work is needed for the mobile app.

Mike: I'll put together a requirements doc by Friday.

Sarah: Excellent. Any other concerns or blockers?

Lisa: Just one question - what's our target launch date for the mobile app?

Sarah: We're aiming for end of Q1, so late March. But we need the MVP features defined by end of December.

John: That's tight but doable if we start the React Native setup in early January.

Sarah: Alright, let's wrap up. To summarize: John leads API refactoring with Mike's support, Lisa delivers dashboard mockups by Dec 20th and mobile mockups by Dec 15th, we're going with React Native for mobile, and I'll get clarity on backend resources by end of week.

Everyone: Sounds good!

Sarah: Thanks everyone. Let's crush Q4!
